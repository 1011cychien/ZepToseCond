A sequence of non-negative integers $d_1\ge\cdots\ge d_n$ can be represented as the degree sequence of a finite simple graph on $n$ vertices if and only if $d_1+\cdots+d_n$ is even and $\displaystyle\sum_{i-1}^kd_i\le k(k-1)+\displaystyle\sum_{i=k+1}^n\min(d_i,k)$ holds for every $k$ in $1\le k\le n$.
